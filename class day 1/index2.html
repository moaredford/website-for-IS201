            STORY <br><br>
            Little Bit About Me
            A little about me, Moa Redford; trilingual as I grew up in Norway with a Swedish mother and absorbing
            english though
            an international kindergarten, loves the outdoors as you would if you lived in the breathtaking nature of
            the north
            and an incredibly independent go getter when it comes to life and achieving what I feel is the right path
            for me. My
            story has made me who I am today. I grew up with the strongest mother you could ever imagine. She is most
            definitely
            the person in my life where I get my determination and independence from as I saw her work endless hours to
            provide for
            my brother and I. With determination comes a wild imagination of what is possible, the only person in my way
            is myself.
            Imagination that creates the vision I want for my future family, my career and also for the bucket list
            items I have every
            intent of crossing off. Some of which have been done, including going on an exchange year across the world
            from Norway to
            Mountain Green Utah for a year during high school to experience something completely new and enjoy the
            journey and experiences
            that laid beyond my comfort zone, and also of serving a mission. Serving a full time mission definitely was
            not always on my
            bucket list. However, when life was not going to my plans, it was at this point I came to understand the
            greater desire I had
            to follow the Lord's plan for me and how I did and always will trust Him and His plan more than my own.
            Coming from a family
            of converts, the journey of gaining a deep relationship with my Heavenly Father was never taught to me, it
            was the definition
            of a personal journey. A journey I never knew would be so life changing to me. Due to the family
            circumstances I have had, I
            have become a person who immensely values learning about others' journey and connecting with people who may
            seem as strangers
            at first, but to me in some cases soon become what feels like family. <br><br>

            Ambisious & Leader
            I am the founder and owner of my own company (Redford & Co.). In my family we all make our own companies
            when we turn eighteen.
            My company and I have been hired for different services, all from home interior design, yard design,
            catering for large hundred
            people events, delivering orders of baked goods. Growing up being able to increase my mindset of how to grow
            as a person within
            my own personal potential and translating that into professional growth for my own company has been a
            journey or making calculated
            decisions. Being the owner and founder (leader) of my own I have had to start to learn more about marketing
            and customer service.
            I have had the great opportunities to be a team leader in aspects of various sports and also in youth camps.
            Both of which have been
            leadership positions where it is more focused on listening to the needs of those around me and being able to
            apply that to the desired
            outcome for the circumstances before us. <br><br>
            Serving a mission is a time where you get to learn more about yourself and really dig deep to understand you
            and others. As I served
            in London I had the great learning and leading experience of being a train for a new missionary. This really
            involved being able to
            slow down the pace and meet someone where they are and at the same time being able to see where there is
            room and potential to
            challenge them to be just one percent better every day. And not only the new missionary, but also within
            myself. Each day, I could
            see where we could have done better, where they had great potential, and where I had the humbling experience
            to see where I lacked
            in various areas. Leading is not always about showing the way, it is about being a helping hand on someone
            else's road.
